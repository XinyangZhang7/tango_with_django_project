The main branch that I'm working on is 'master'. Please check this branch to evaluate my work.

I tried to create a new branch every chapter before chapter5. After the live lecture on Tuesday, I merged them to the master branch, because professor said it would be better if commit all changes onto master branch.

All the tests are passed, except chapter 9. The message said "The Add Category link was present on Rango's homepage when a user is not logged in. This shouldn't be the case! Please check your base.html template".

However, I checked many times and I 'm sure my code is totally fine. Here is the screen shot. And as you can see the Add Category link never shows on homepage when a user is not logged in.

If this failure affect my grade, please allow me to explain for myself.
